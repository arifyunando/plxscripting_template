# PLAXIS Geotechnical Software Scripting Helper and Templates

## Introduction
This repository containts wrapper functions and some template files that can be used to generate and set up model in PLAXIS 2D (maybe PLAXIS 3D too). TO use this library however, the `plxscripting` library is needed. And obviously, a valid PLAXIS 2D license with [Geotechnical SELECT Entitlements](https://communities.bentley.com/products/geotech-analysis/w/wiki/50223/geotechnical-select-entitlements-gse) activated.

### About **PLAXIS 2D**
> PLAXIS 2D is a powerful and user-friendly finite-element (FE) software for 2D analysis of deformation and stability in geotechnical engineering and rock mechanics. PLAXIS is used worldwide by top engineering companies and institutions in the civil and geotechnical engineering industry. PLAXIS 2D is ideal for a range of applications from excavations, embankments, and foundations to tunneling, mining, oil and gas, and reservoir geomechanics.
> PLAXIS 2D includes all the essentials to perform deformation and safety analysis for soil and rock that do not require the consideration of creep, steady state groundwater or thermal flow, consolidation analysis, or any time-dependent effects.

More information regarding PLAXIS 2D can be found at their [site](https://www.bentley.com/software/plaxis-2d/).
